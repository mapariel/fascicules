{Version 1}

This class allows LaTeX users to create mathematics books for secondary/upper secondary schools and using LaTeX.

This package provides commands to create the front page of the manual and the chapters. Each chapter can consist of three sections: the lesson, the exercises and the activities.

In the version 1, the manual will be preferably in French. This can be easily improved in a near future.
